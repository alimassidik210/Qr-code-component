## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

In this simple project, I practiced how to create a project that aligns with the design provided by UI/UX. Additionally, in this project, I trained myself to write a README.md file to clearly explain a project to the public.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="card">
  <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="code QR" width="" />
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
    <p>
      Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to
      the next level
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.container .card-content {
  text-align: center;
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  font-optical-sizing: auto;
  font-weight: 400;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

"In the next project, I want to use SASS to make writing CSS code simpler."
